**Old School Runescape (OSRS) Highscore Comparison Tool made as a personal project specifically for my group ironman duo.**

A web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript designed to compare the skill experience progression of two OSRS accounts.
The tool fetches liva data from the official OSRS Highscores API and features local storage integration using JSON to track and display recent
experience gained between page visits.

**Key Features:**
  - Liva API fetching
  - XP Difference Color grading
  - Persistent Data storage to display recent XP gains
